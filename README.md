# Get-next-line
4th project of [42 School](https://www.42.fr) "Introduction to C" Branch.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a function which reads a single line from a file descriptor, assuming it isn't being tampered with in between calls to the function.

It must fit in one source file and one header and have no memory leak. Usage of static variables is allowed.
